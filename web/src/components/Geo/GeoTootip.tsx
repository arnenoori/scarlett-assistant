          How the map is calculated

        <p>
          We analyze all quailified commits to the repo and collect all users
          from them. Then we &quot;parse&quot; users location based on
          information in their public profile. Because not all users specify
          their location or sometimes specify something unindentifible, this map
          is only approximate, but still can provide some insights into
          geography of your contributors.

          Commits vs contributors
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can select how you want the map to be calculated. <b>Commits </b>
          option highlights countries by the number of commits originating from
          this country, while <b>contributors</b> highlight countries based on
          number of contributors coming from a particular country.
