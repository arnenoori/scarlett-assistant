Your consent permits the general use of electronic records and electronic signatures in connection with the services in which You use USPS Electronic Signature Online.

When using USPS Electronic Signature Online and choosing to apply that signature to a particular item being delivered to Your address or Post Office Box, you acknowledge and agree that You are authorizing the Postal Service to leave the item addressed to You or others in Your household, in your mailbox if it fits or where you indicate in your profile if the item is too large for your mailbox, and to include your electronic signature in a proof of delivery letter available to the sender. In such instances, You agree to release the Postal Service and the sender of the item from all liability, including but not limited to for loss or misdelivery of the package. In addition, You warrant and represent to the Postal Service that You are authorized by Your housemates to use Your electronic signature to acknowledge receipt for deliveries addressed to them.

You may request to receive and provide all transactional information and forms in paper form as an alternative to utilizing USPS Electronic Signature Online, but in such instance(s) we cannot process Your request(s) or perform the services You desire electronically through the use of USPS Electronic Signature Online. You may withdraw Your consent at any time by modifying your settings in customer registration. In each instance where You are prompted for use of USPS Electronic Signature Online, You will be given this opportunity.
