1. AGREEMENT
1.1 What is My Agreement? Your Agreement for the Service consists of these Terms and Conditions and your Personal Service Plan, as maintained at www.mobileespn.com and as may be revised from time to time by Mobile ESPN (the “Terms and Conditions” and “Service Plan”, respectively). Your Service Plan consists of the rates and fea- tures you selected from our available service plan options. YOU SHOULD REVIEW CAREFULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOUR SERVICE PLAN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROVISIONS GOVERNING OUR RIGHTS TO CHANGE THIS AGREEMENT, MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DIS- PUTES, EARLY TERMINATION FEES, LATE PAYMENTS, PRIVACY, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. To the extent any condition of your Service Plan expressly conflicts with the Terms and Conditions, the condition in your Service Plan will govern. You acknowledge that no employee, dealer or other agent of Mobile ESPN is authorized to waive or modify any terms or provisions of the Agreement.
1.2 Acceptance of Agreement. You accept this Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) accept through an oral statement or provide your written or electronic signature; (b) activate your Service through your Phone; (c) attempt to or in any way use your Phone or the Service; or (d) pay for the Service, in whole or in part. You must activate your Service within 30 days after purchase of your Phone (unless returned as provided in Section 3). If you do not activate your Service or return your Phone within 30 days, you are deemed to accept the Agreement and you agree to pay all charges in accordance with this Agreement.
1.3 Your Representations. By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you are (a) at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to accept this Agreement; or (b) if acting on behalf of an entity, authorized to legally bind the entity. If you are acting on behalf of a corporate entity, you represent that the execution of this Agreement has been authorized by all necessary corporate actions.
1.4 Credit Check. Before activating your Phone and offering Service to you, we may check your credit and verify your identity, and you hereby provide your consent for us to do so. You must have and maintain satisfactory credit to receive and continue to receive the Service. Based on your creditworthiness, we may, in our discretion, estab- lish a limit (“Limit”) and restrict your Service, including the features you may receive. If your account balance goes beyond the Limit, we may immediately suspend your Service until your balance is brought below the Limit. Any bal- ances in excess of the Limit are due and payable immediately. You acknowledge that Mobile ESPN may provide your payment history and other billing/charge information regarding the Service to any credit reporting agency or indus- try clearinghouse.
1.5 Deposit. In addition to a non-refundable Activation Fee, we may, at any time in our sole discretion, charge a deposit, prepayment or other fee to establish or maintain your Service (“Deposit”). If we require an increase in your Deposit, you may terminate your Service without any Early Termination Fee by contacting us within thirty days. In the event that you do not pay the increase in your Deposit and have not terminated your Service pursuant to this sec- tion of the Agreement, Mobile ESPN has a right to limit or restrict services. We may mix your Deposit with other funds. We will pay simple interest on any Deposit at the rate the law requires. You agree that we can apply any Deposit in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account. You cannot use a Deposit to pay any amount due to us unless we agree. Any Deposit remaining at the end of your Term will be returned to you at your last known address. If your Deposit is returned to us as undeliverable, we will hold it for you for up to one year from the date of return and we may, to the extent permitted by law, charge a monthly servicing fee against the Deposit. Please retain proof of your Deposit.
1.6 Changes. Your use of the Service is subject to the business policies and procedures of Mobile ESPN.
(a) UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE MAY CHANGE ANY TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. ANY CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT
           1

ARE EFFECTIVE WHEN WE PUBLISH THEM ON OUR WEBSITE, www.mobileespn.com. Your contin- ued use of the Service after these changes are effective constitutes your acceptance of the change. You may enroll on our website to receive email notice of any such changes.
(b) We will not change your rates for any portion of the Service without providing written notice to you. If our change has a material adverse effect on you, you may terminate your Service (or that portion that is relat- ed to the change) without any Early Termination Fee, by contacting us within thirty days of the date the change becomes effective. You will, however, be responsible for all charges for the Service up to the date that the Agreement is terminated. You understand and agree that taxes, Universal Service fees and other charges imposed by the government or based on government calculations may increase or decrease on a monthly basis, and that any such change shall not be considered a material adverse change for purposes of the termination right set forth in this section.

For answers to any questions that you may have about your rights and responsibilities under this Agreement, please visit our website at www.mobileespn.com or call Mobile ESPN Customer Care at 866-306-3776, or 611 from your Phone.
2. TERM AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
2.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement begins on the date of your acceptance of this Agreement, and continues for the minimum term provided in your Service Plan, unless earlier terminated or otherwise extended (the “Initial Term” and together with any renewal periods or re-start periods, as defined below, the “Term”). YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMMIT TO A NEW INITIAL TERM IF YOU CHANGE YOUR SERVICE PLAN, PAR- TICIPATE IN A PROMOTION, OR UPGRADE YOUR EQUIPMENT DURING ANY EXISTING TERM OR INI- TIAL TERM. Mobile ESPN may, in its discretion, extend the Term by any period of time during which Service to you was suspended.
2.2 Termination by You. You may terminate your Service before its Term ends by calling Customer Care at 866-306-3776. Any termination by you during a monthly billing cycle becomes effective on the last day of that billing cycle. You must pay all fees and charges incurred prior to the effective termination date, and you will not be entitled to any pro-rated credits or refunds for portions of a billing cycle if you terminate the Service prior to the last day of a billing cycle.
2.3 Termination by Us. Mobile ESPN may terminate or suspend the Agreement or your Service at any time for good cause, including, but not limited to (a) your failure to pay any charges (including, without limitation, any charges assessed on behalf of third parties) when due under this Agreement; (b) if you behave in an abusive, deroga- tory, or otherwise unreasonable manner to any Mobile ESPN employee, representative or agent; (c) if we have rea- son to believe that your Service is being used in a fraudulent manner or for an illegal purpose (such as unusual activ- ity levels or calling patterns); (d) if your Service is being used in a way that adversely affects our other customers’ service or our business operations; (e) if your provide us with credit information that is false, inaccurate, dated or can- not be verified, or you become insolvent or subject to any proceeding under the bankruptcy or similar laws; (f) we discover that you are underage or do not otherwise possess the capacity or the authorization to enter into this Agreement; (g) your use of the Service exceeds any applicable limitations or restrictions or otherwise breaches this Agreement; or (h) you use the Phone in a manner in which it was not intended. You acknowledge that we are not liable to you or to any other party for exercising or failing to exercise our rights to terminate this Agreement.
2.4 Early Termination Fee. Because Mobile ESPN incurs a significant cost in activating the Service, includ- ing a large up-front cost in providing your Phone, YOU MUST PAY US AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE OF $250 (“EARLY TERMINATION FEE”) FOR EACH LINE OF SERVICE TERMINATED BY YOU BEFORE THE EXPIRY OF THE TERM OR TERMINATED BY MOBILE ESPN AT ANY TIME FOR GOOD CAUSE. The Early Termination Fee may be deducted from your Deposit, if any, or any amounts prepaid by you, charged to your credit card, or billed to your account. You do not have to pay the Early Termination Fee if you terminate under our 30-day satisfaction guarantee policy or where the Terms and Conditions otherwise allow you to do so without paying the Early Termination Fee. Payment of the Early Termination Fee does not satisfy other outstanding obligations that may be owed to us upon termination, such as (a) outstanding charges for the Service and/or Phone that accrued prior to termination and (b) term commitments on other lines of service, or Service or equipment-related charges.
2.5 Renewals. Not less than 30 days before the Initial Term expires, we will provide notice to you about an upcoming renewal (“Renewal Notice”). You will have the option of (a) renewing the Agreement for an additional two-year term; (b) renewing the Agreement on a month-to-month basis; or (c) terminating the Agreement. You acknowledge that we may charge higher rates for month-to-month Service. Unless prohibited by applicable state or federal law, if you do not respond to the Renewal Notice within 30 days of the date of the Renewal Notice, you will be deemed to have selected to renew the Agreement for an additional two-year term. However, you may cancel your
       2

Service within 30 days following the start of any two-year renewal period without paying the Early Termination Fee. With respect to month-to-month customers, either you or Mobile ESPN may cancel the Service at any time upon 30 days prior notice.
3. SATISFACTION GUARANTEE
3.1 30 Day Guaranty. If during the first 30 days of the Initial Term, you are not satisfied with the Service or your Phone for any reason, you may return your Phone in like-new condition for a full refund of the purchase price of the Phone (less any post-purchase rebates) plus any pre-paid equipment protection or roadside assistance fees (“Refund”). The Refund does not include your Activation Fee, any voice or data usage charges incurred through the date on which you return your Phone, and any charges for downloads, directory assistance, international dialing, roaming and other Services. Upon return of your Phone by you in accordance with this Section 3, we will terminate your Service.
3.2 Return Procedure. You must follow the procedure outlined below if you seek to return your Phone or any other accessory:
(a) You must return your Phone in “like-new” condition with proof of purchase along with its original pack- aging and contents and all original accessories that accompanied the Phone. You may be required to pay a restocking fee, as well as a separate fee if we determine in our sole discretion that your returned Phone is not in “like-new” condition.
(b) If you purchased your Phone from a retailer, you must return your Phone to the retailer. If you purchased your Phone from the Web or Telesales, you must contact ESPN Customer Care at 866-306-3776 to arrange for a Return Authorization.
4. MOBILE ESPN SERVICE
4.1 General Service Provisions/Use of Service.
(a) We obtain transmission services through the Sprint wireless network (which may in turn utilize networks and facilities provided by third parties) (collectively, the “Network”), and through third parties that provide roaming services to the Network. A Phone that we specify to be compatible with the Network is required for access to the Service. We may periodically program your Phone remotely with system settings for roaming service and other features that cannot be changed manually. Roaming availability may be restricted in certain areas to prevent fraud, as determined by the third party roaming partner or by Mobile ESPN in its reasonable discretion.
(b) You agree to not use or attempt to use the Service in an unlawful, fraudulent, harassing or abusive man- ner or in any manner that could result in damage or risk to the business, reputation, properties or services of Mobile ESPN or to Mobile ESPN’s subscribers, third parties, or to the public generally (“Improper Use”). We may determine on a case-by-case basis what constitutes an Improper Use. You may not resell or lease the Service to anyone, whether for a profit or otherwise. If we suspect a violation of this provision, we may (i) begin legal action; (ii) suspend or terminate your Service immediately without prior notice; (iii) suspend or terminate service provided to you under any other agreement with us; and (iv) cooperate with law enforcement in prose- cuting offenders. You agree to cooperate with us in investigating suspected violations.
4.2 Coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere. See our mapping brochure or visit our website for approximate outdoor coverage information. Under Mobile ESPN’s arrangement with Sprint, Mobile ESPN customers have access to voice and data services anywhere on the Nationwide Sprint PCS Network. Mobile ESPN customers also have access to high-speed data services in the Sprint wireless high-speed data (EvDO) coverage areas. Data serv- ices will not be available while roaming outside of the Nationwide Sprint PCS Network.
(a) Maps are not precise. COVERAGE MAPS OF YOUR SERVICE AREA ONLY APPROXIMATE THE ACTUAL AREA OVER WHICH YOUR PHONE WILL OPERATE. Actual service area, coverage and qual- ity may change without notice. There may be gaps in Service within the estimated coverage areas shown on coverage maps.
(b) Other Conditions Affecting Service. Even within a coverage area, factors such as weather conditions, geo- graphic locations and terrains, network changes, buildings and other structures, emergencies, traffic volume, transmission limits, service outages, technical limitations, signal strength, your Phone, interconnecting carriers and other circumstances, including but not limited to, priority access by emergency service providers in the event of a disaster or emergency, may interfere with the actual quality and availability of your Service and may cause dropped or blocked calls, interruption or delay in the coverage and quality of your Service.
       3

4.3 International Calls and International Roaming. Service for calls made to international destinations may be limited at our discretion. You should contact Customer Care at 866-306-3776 if you plan on making international calls (i.e., either calls placed from the United States to an international destination, or calls placed from an international location to any destination worldwide) from your Phone for more information, including information on internation- al destinations you cannot call and other relevant limitations. A current list of countries you will be able to receive calls from and place calls to is available at www.mobileespn.com. International dialing rates and other applicable charges will vary based on the network you are on at the time of the call. Customers must contact us to request the ability to place calls from an international location and roam internationally. International calling will be provided at Mobile ESPN’s discretion. The ability to place calls from an international location will be restricted based on credit class, and may require a deposit.
4.4 Roaming – Voice, Data, SMS. “Roaming” occurs whenever you make or receive calls when your Phone is off of the Network. Your Phone is designed and engineered to fully function on the Network. Calls made to or from your Phone when your Phone is off of the Network will only work if Mobile ESPN or the carrier from whom we obtain transmission services has an agreement in place with another provider, and those calls will be subject to roam- ing fees. SOME FEATURES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN ROAMING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMIT- ED TO, INTERNET ACCESS, INTERNATIONAL CALLS, DATA SERVICES AND TEXT MESSAGES.
4.5 Voice Services.
(a) Voicemail. You will need to set up your voicemail when your Service is activated. We may deactivate your voicemail if you do not set it up within a reasonable time after your Service is activated. We will reactivate your voicemail upon your request. We may limit the number of voicemail messages that can be maintained through your Mobile ESPN account.
(b) Caller ID. The Caller ID feature may display the incoming call number on your Phone. Your Number and name may be displayed to receiving parties when you make outgoing calls. Caller ID may be blocked for many calls by dialing *67 before each call, although your number may appear on the recipient’s bill.
(c) 900 numbers/Pay-Per-Call Numbers. We may block calls from your Number to 900, 976 and similar num- bers for pay-per-call services.
(d) Unavailability of Voice Services. You will not be able to receive incoming calls while your Phone is in data mode, or when using some other Services. When this occurs, incoming calls will be sent to your voice- mail. The Service may not be compatible with, and in certain circumstances we may block, voice-over-Internet- protocol (VoIP) services and features
4.6 Data and Premium Services and Content.
(a) Depending upon your Service Plan, a variety of content provided by ESPN and third parties is available to you. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OPINIONS, ADVICE, STATEMENTS, SERVICES, APPLICATIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ESPN OR THIRD PARTIES AND ACCES- SIBLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. NEITHER WE NOR OUR VENDORS AND LICENSORS GUARAN- TEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS OR TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION THAT IS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE. You are responsible for evaluating such content. You are also responsible for any use of our Service through any Phone on your account including, but not limited to, use by children or minors. We strongly recommend that you closely monitor any such usage.
(b) Premium Content Services. Your Service Plan may allow for access to and downloads of Premium Content Services without charge or for an additional charge. Premium Content Services may not be available while roaming.
(c) We may limit the number of text messages that you receive and the amount of data that you can access or download through your Mobile ESPN account. We may also delete premium and non-premium items down- loaded to available storage areas (e.g., personal vault) on your Phone, including any pictures, games, ringers or screen savers. We may terminate your Service if your use is excessive with respect to the volume of text mes- sages and/or data services when compared to the predominant volume of text messages and/or data services of customers on similar rate plans or in your geographical area.
4.7 Emergency Services /E911. You may make 911 emergency calls from your Phone. The Service does not interact with 911 and other emergency services in the same manner as non-wireless or landline telephone services. Depending upon your location, the type of Phone you use, the type of equipment being utilized by any applicable emergency service provider, and the circumstances and conditions of a particular call, your Number and/or location may not be identifiable to emergency service providers and you may not be connected to the appropriate emergency
         4

service provider. In certain circumstances, a 911 call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher. Mobile ESPN com- plies with all applicable E911 FCC regulations designed to help authorities locate users of the Service who make 911 calls. You acknowledge that E911 service is not available in all areas, and is not completely reliable. You will not be charged for 911 calls.
4.8 Telephone Number and Portability.
(a) Telephone Number. We will assign you a wireless Phone number (“Number”) with your Service. Except for any rights you may have to port your Number, your Number is not your property. You may not assign your Number to any other Phone and shall not program any other number into your Phone. In the event your serv- ice is terminated or suspended, you may be assigned a new Number when you re-connect with Mobile ESPN Service. We may charge you to change your Number. We will not accept requests for new vanity numbers.
(b) Telephone Number Portability. You may request that your Number(s) be ported to another service provider to the extent permitted by applicable law. Upon such request, all amounts then owed to Mobile ESPN (including any Early Termination Fees and any charges, fees or amounts that appear on the final invoice) shall become immediately due and payable, and your failure to provide timely payment to us could delay our facil- itation of your porting request. We will treat the request we receive from your new service provider as notice from you to terminate our service to that Number. We will terminate your Service after the Number has been successfully ported. If you are porting a phone number from another company, we may not be able to provide you with some services immediately, such as 911 location services.
5. FEES.
5.1 General. Your use of the Service is subject to the fees set forth below or elsewhere in this Agreement and those set forth in your Service Plan. You are responsible for all fees associated with any activity on your Phone regard- less of who initiates or authorizes the activity. To determine whether certain fees, taxes and surcharges are applicable to the Service provided to you, we must obtain your street address, which must be within our service area. You rep- resent that the address you provide when activating Service is correct and you acknowledge that we are relying on this information. In the event you do not provide us with a valid address or fail to notify us of an address change, you understand that you may be responsible for additional fees, taxes and surcharges for your Service, and we may ter- minate your Service.
5.2 Activation Fee. We may charge a non-refundable fee to activate new service, change existing service, or upgrade equipment (the “Activation Fee”). We will provide you with notice of any Activation Fee before charging you the fee.
5.3 Roaming. Domestic and international roaming rates offered by a third party vendor or by the visited net- work may vary.
5.4 Voice Charges. You will be charged for incoming and outgoing calls at the rates set forth in your Service Plan including rates for exceeding the number of minutes included in your Service Plan. AIRTIME USAGE IS BILLED IN FULL MINUTE INCREMENTS WITH A MINIMUM CHARGE OF ONE MINUTE PER CALL. PARTIAL MINUTES OF AIRTIME USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP AND CHARGED, OR DEDUCTED FROM ANY INCLUDED MINUTES, AS FULL MINUTES. UNUSED MINUTES EXPIRE AT THE END OF EACH BILLING CYCLE AND DO NOT CARRY OVER TO SUBSEQUENT BILLING CYCLES. Time starts when you first press SEND or the call connects to a network on outgoing calls, and when the call connects to a network (which may be before your Phone rings) on incoming calls. Time ends when the call disconnects from a network (which may be several seconds after you press END). For calls made on the Network, we only charge for calls that connect (which includes calls with at least 30 seconds of ringtime and calls answered by machines, regardless of whether a person answers or a message is left). Charges for calls placed or received while roaming may be determined using methods other than the method specified in this Section.
5.5 Toll Free Calls. Calls to 800 numbers are charged airtime at the rates set forth in Section 5.4.

5.8 Daytime/Nights & Weekends Pricing. Certain plans have “Daytime” and “Nights & Weekends” rates (a “Daytime/Nights & Weekends Plan”). If you have a Daytime/Nights & Weekends Plan, you will be charged Daytime
             5

hour rates for those portions of a call that occur during “Daytime” hours, and “Nights & Weekends” hour rates for those portions of a call made or received from or to your Number during “Nights & Weekends” hours.
5.9 Voicemail Messages. You may check your voice mail from any wireless or wireline Phone. If you check your voicemail from your Phone, you will be charged airtime charges as described in Section 5.4. These charges will not apply if you check your voicemail from a wireline Phone or any other wireless Phone.
5.10 Text Messages. Your Service Plan may provide for an allotment of text messages (“Text Message Allotment”). Each message sent or received counts against your Text Message Allotment. You will be charged an additional fee for text messages in excess of your Text Message Allotment, but will not incur additional airtime charges. UNUSED TEXT MESSAGE ALLOTMENTS EXPIRE AT THE END OF EACH BILLING CYCLE AND DO NOT CARRY OVER TO SUBSEQUENT BILLING CYCLES.
5.11 Data Charges. You may incur data usage charges as long as you are logged on to the Network. Data charges will vary depending upon your Service Plan, the amount of data you use while accessing particular applica- tions and services, and other circumstances surrounding your data use. You will incur additional charges for exceed- ing the data usages included in your Service Plan. You will also incur additional charges to access data not included in your Service Plan. In addition, you will be charged for partial or interrupted data downloads, including data that is automatically resent. You acknowledge that data services provided by third parties may cost more than data service provided by Mobile ESPN. DATA TRANSPORT IS BILLED IN FULL KILOBYTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTU- AL TRANSPORT IS ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL KILOBYTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH DATA SESSION FOR BILLING PURPOSES. NETWORK OVERHEAD, SOFTWARE UPDATE REQUESTS, AND RESEND REQUESTS CAUSED BY NETWORK ERRORS CAN INCREASE MEASURED KILOBYTES. UNUSED KILOBYTES EXPIRE AT THE END OF EACH BILLING CYCLE AND DO NOT CARRY OVER TO SUBSEQUENT BILLING CYCLES. Access time may be measured from the time the port is seized to the time the port is released by your equipment. Estimates of data usage may vary from actual use. Your invoice will not sepa- rately identify the number of kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services used.
5.12 Taxes, Fees and Assessments. Mobile ESPN is required by law to charge you certain taxes, surcharges and assessments. These taxes, surcharges and assessments will be included on your bill. You are responsible to pay all such taxes, surcharges and assessments imposed on the products and services provided, together with your month- ly fees for the products and services provided. These taxes, surcharges and assessments may change from time to time and we are not required to give you advance notice of any such changes. Except as prohibited by law, we may also, in our discretion, require you to pay regulatory and administrative fees to recover our costs of complying with cer- tain regulatory mandates and Universal Service fees or similarly imposed charges. Any Customer who is eligible for an exemption from any tax or fee must provide us with a valid and properly executed tax-exempt certificate which will be verified by us. Any tax exemption applies only after the date we receive the certificate from you and have ver- ified your eligibility for the exemption.
