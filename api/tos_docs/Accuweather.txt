AccuWeather takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Submission. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, you agree that AccuWeather shall not be responsible or liable for any injuries or damages you may sustain in connection with the creation or production of your Submission(s) (for instance, if you suffer injuries while filming a video for submission to AccuWeather). Please make sure to take all necessary precautions.

All Submissions must be your sole, original work. No copyrighted music, trademarks, brands, or other intellectual property not owned by you may be used in your Submission. We will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate your account, and remove or disable your Submissions in the event of a dispute regarding intellectual property rights. AccuWeather also reserves the right to reject or remove any Submission, in its sole discretion, for any reason.

22. Modifications. AccuWeather may modify this Agreement at any time, and the new terms and conditions will become effective by posting the new terms and conditions in the same location as the previous terms and conditions were posted. AccuWeather has the right at any time to modify or cancel any feature or functionality of the Site, including hours of availability, content, applications, and equipment requirements for use with the Products and/or services, and AccuWeather reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to this Site and/or the Products and/or services provided without prior notice in the event you are in violation of these terms of use, or for scheduled or unscheduled support and maintenance on the Site.

23. Terms of Service. These Terms and Conditions are effective upon acceptance, and shall remain and continue until terminated. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligation hereunder may be assigned by you without the express written permission of AccuWeather, and any purported transfer of rights shall oblige the transferee to these Terms and Conditions, and your rights will be terminated. You may terminate these Terms and Conditions by destroying, removing or obliterating the Products and all copies thereof, and certifying as such to AccuWeather. AccuWeather may terminate your right to use the Site and its Products and services upon the breach by you of any provision contained in these Terms and Conditions, any applicable Provider Terms, Subscription Terms, the End User License Agreement, or the Privacy Statement governing this Site and downloaded Products. Upon such termination by AccuWeather, you agree to certify the destruction, removal or obliteration of the Products and all copies thereof to AccuWeather.

24. Notice. Posting of notice(s) on the Site by AccuWeather shall constitute notice to you. Written notice of termination and requests for credit (as applicable - see Subscription Terms) shall be provided in the following manner: email notification to webhelp@accuwx.com or facsimile notification at 814-238-1339, Attn: Webmaster. No credits or refunds are available for cancellation of monthly wireless services.

25. Choice of Laws / Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with the exception of export control, infra, which is governed by US Federal law. Any dispute arising out of this Agreement or related thereto shall be subject to the jurisdiction of said Courts located within Pennsylvania, and it is further agreed that any and all matters of dispute shall be adjudicated, governed and controlled under and by Pennsylvania law.

26. Subscription Terms. You agree to pay to AccuWeather the fees stated or as specified from time to time for various fee-based Products and services available by or through AccuWeather, and you are responsible for promptly paying for AccuWeather Products and services. Failure to pay these fees in a timely manner will result in an interruption of fee-based Site Products and services and the functional inability to access the fee-based sections of the Site. Charges will be calculated based upon the subscription package selected, and are applicable to the current version of the package selected. Upgrades related to Hardware changes or new releases may be subject to additional charges. "Lifetime" subscription packages relate only to the Products initially downloaded or accessed by you, and do not extend to upgrades to the Products or different Hardware. AccuWeather reserves the right to discontinue and/or cancel Lifetime Subscriptions for wireless Products, so long as AccuWeather provides you a free upgrade to a different Product for your wireless device. Failure of payment shall render due and payable all sums plus a late payment charge of one and one half percent per month. Fees may be prorated for portions of months. Use of the service beyond the free time or without proper authorization will result in charges to billing or credit card account. Fees and payment terms therefore are subject to change upon Notice by AccuWeather to you. Packages, once purchased, are nonrefundable, regardless of use or lack of use by you. Absolutely no credits or refunds are available for month-to-month or one-time fee-based services, including, without limitation, mobile/wireless service packages. Once a charge has been processed to your credit card or wireless account, you shall not request that your credit card or mobile carrier company reverse the charge or charge it back to AccuWeather. If you have a legitimate basis to request a credit for a charge previously processed against his or her credit card account, he or she shall request a credit from AccuWeather by written notice and resolve the issue directly with AccuWeather. Any reversed charges which cause the credit card company to impose a charge back, refund, or credit cost against AccuWeather shall be reimposed by AccuWeather upon you. Such costs may exceed the cost of the reversed item or charge back by many times.

27. Renewal Terms. Monthly subscription packages shall continue to renew monthly until proper termination notification is received from you. Upon expiration of subscription period for any 6 Month Special and One Year Supersaver packages, you will be renewed on monthly subscription terms unless proper termination notification is received from you.

28. LANGUAGE. TO THE EXTENT THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE TRANSLATED INTO A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND THERE IS A CONFLICT OF TERMS BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND THE OTHER LANGUAGE, THE ENGLISH VERSION SHALL CONTROL. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY, SO PLEASE CHECK BACK OFTEN.

29. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THESE TERMS OF USAGE, TOGETHER WITH ACCUWEATHER'S PRIVACY STATEMENT AND ANY END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, SUBSCRIPTION TERMS, PROVIDER TERMS AND/OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR TERMS APPEARING OR REFERENCED ON THIS SITE AND/OR ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN WRITING REPRESENT THE ENTIRE SET OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ANY PRODUCTS (WHERE APPLICABLE) ACCESSED THROUGH THIS SITE, AND IT SUPERSEDES ANY PRIOR PROPOSAL, REPRESENTATION, OR UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

The AccuWeather application you are using may allow you to post certain types of information through the application for other users to view and/or to view certain information posted by other users of the application (any such information posted by you or other users, "Crowdsourced Data").

By posting any Crowdsourced Data, you are consenting to AccuWeather’s collection, storage and use of such location data (in combination with other data such as an AccuWeather assigned ID) for any purpose, including by way of example but without limitation delivering the functionality of the AccuWeather application to you and other users, making improvements to forecasts and other AccuWeather products and services and using for other business purposes.
If you post Crowdsourced Data, you grant AccuWeather and its affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, host, cache, store, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and publicly display such Crowdsourced Data throughout the world in any media for any purpose. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be compensated in any way for any Crowdsourced Data you provide.
You are responsible for ensuring that any Crowdsourced Data you submit is complete, current and accurate to the best of your knowledge and you shall not provide any Crowdsourced Data that is intentionally misleading or that violates AccuWeather’s Acceptable Use Policy which can be found in Section 4 above. You also affirm that you have the right to submit any Crowdsourced Data that you post. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold AccuWeather and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims, demands, actions, and any liabilities, damages or expenses resulting therefrom, arising out of or relating to any Crowdsourced Data that you submit.
AccuWeather does not guarantee that any Crowdsourced Data will be accurate, reliable or complete, and AccuWeather does not make any representations or warranties of any kind regarding Crowdsourced Data. You acknowledge that AccuWeather has no obligation to pre-screen or validate Crowdsourced Data contributed by users.

AccuWeather and its Providers make no express or implied warranties, guarantees or affirmations that weather information will occur or has occurred as the reports, forecasts, alerts, data, or information state, represent or depict and it shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever to Licensee or any other person or entity, parties and non-parties alike, for any inconsistency, inaccuracy, or omission for weather or events predicted or depicted, reported, occurring or occurred. You acknowledge that some of the weather data and information made available by AccuWeather may be generated by users (e.g., Crowdsourced Data) in which case AccuWeather will simply be passing on the data and/or information it receives from the user to You via the application. AccuWeather does not guarantee that any data or information originating from a user will be accurate or complete and AccuWeather does not make any representations or warranties of any kind regarding any such data or information originating from a user. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SOFTWARE, DATA AND/OR DOCUMENTATION MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES AND LICENSEE WILL USE COMMON SENSE AND FOLLOW STANDARD SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH LICENSEE'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE, DATA OR DOCUMENTATION.

LICENSEE AND THIRD PARTIES ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTION OR LACK OF ACTION TAKEN TO PRESERVE LIFE OR PROPERTY.

11. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACCUWEATHER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INJURY, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, AND/OR LOSS OF PROFITS ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO, IN ANY MANNER, THIS EULA OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR THE DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS, OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, DATA OR DOCUMENTATION REGARDLESS OF THE FORESEEABILITY THEREOF. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABLITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF ACCUWEATHER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND PROVIDERS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS EULA OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $1.00 OR 50% OF THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO ACCUWEATHER UNDER THIS EULA AND ANY APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. The limited warranty, exclusive remedies, and limited liability set forth in this EULA are fundamental elements of the basis of the EULA and the other Terms and Conditions which apply. Licensee agrees AccuWeather would not be able to provide the Software, Data and/or Documentation to Licensee on an economic basis without such limitations.

13. Advertisements. The Software, Data and other products or services of AccuWeather contain information of high economic value and are provided to you free of charge because they are supported by advertisers and therefore may include advertising for products and services offered by the Provider or third parties. This advertising support is significant and allows us to provide such products and services as a public service to people who can, and those who cannot, afford to pay the high cost of operating such products and services. The advertising may be targeted to information related to the type of weather information you access, your search requests, or other information consistent with our Privacy Statement (https://www.accuweather.com/en/privacy). AccuWeather would incur substantial unreimbursed costs in connection with the product(s) or service(s) furnished to you without the ability to display advertising. Accordingly, we ask for your help in exchange for our free license to you to access the Software, Data and/or other products or services of AccuWeather. You agree that advertising is, and will continue to be, a part of the Software, Data and any other products or services of AccuWeather provided to you, and you agree not to block the advertising on the Software or Data or on other products or services of AccuWeather, whether through the use of technology or other means. Doing so is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions for which AccuWeather reserves the right to charge you fees for the use of the Software, Data or such other products or services of AccuWeather or to seek other legal damages. AccuWeather may utilize technology or other measures to bypass attempts to block advertising and you agree to cooperate with AccuWeather in doing so. AccuWeather makes no representations or warranties with respect to the quality, appropriateness, accuracy, truthfulness, reliability, business ethics, or other aspects of any such advertisements and/or the organizations placing the advertisements and shall have no responsibility or liability for any claims arising out of or related to any such advertisements, the contents thereof, the products or services promoted therein, or the fulfillment thereof. It is a user's sole responsibility to satisfy himself or herself as to the desirability of dealing with any given advertiser and to understand the relationship is between the user and the advertiser and not with AccuWeather. AccuWeather may display political advertising as a business transaction, from advocacy groups and candidates for office. AccuWeather does not endorse candidates for political office or endorse any political statements, positions or issues.

14. High Risk Activities. The Software, Data and Documentation is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software, Data or Documentation could lead directly to death, personal injury or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly, AccuWeather and its Providers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.

15. Events Beyond AccuWeather Inc.'s Control. AccuWeather shall not be held responsible for any failure or malfunction in power or communications nor the failure or refusal of third party transmission intermediaries to perform, continue or renew their contractual arrangements with AccuWeather, nor inability to perform occasioned by such or by labor strife, war, riot, terrorism, natural disasters, severe weather or other events beyond the control of AccuWeather. The unavailability of Software, Data or Documentation from AccuWeather's Providers shall not be considered a disruption of services and shall not affect the obligations of Licensee hereunder.

16. Governing Law & Jurisdiction. The parties agree to submit to the Pennsylvania Courts only, for any dispute arising out of this EULA or any other applicable Terms and Conditions or related thereto, and consent to the jurisdiction of said Courts and further agree that any and all matters of dispute shall be adjudicated, governed and controlled under and by Pennsylvania law and this paragraph shall supersede any conflicting choice of law rules. The parties expressly stipulate that the 1980 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply, nor shall the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

17. Severability. In the event any term of this EULA, or any term of any other applicable Terms and Conditions, is found by any Court to be void or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this EULA, or the remainder of such other Terms and Conditions, as the case may be, shall remain valid and enforceable as though such term were absent upon the date of its execution as long as a party's rights under this EULA or the applicable Terms and Conditions are not materially affected. In lieu of the unenforceable provision, the parties will substitute or add as part of this EULA or the applicable Terms and Conditions a provision that will be as similar as possible in economic and business objectives as was intended by the unenforceable provision.

18. Indemnity. Licensee hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold AccuWeather and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and Providers (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) harmless from and against any and all claims, demands and actions, and any liabilities, damages or expense resulting therefrom including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with any breach of this EULA or any other applicable Terms and Conditions or any act or omission on the Licensee's part relating to the use or possession by Licensee of Software, Data or Documentation.

19. Export Restrictions and Legal Compliance. Licensee acknowledges that the Software, Data, Documentation and other underlying information or technology licensed hereunder is subject to the export control laws and regulations of the U.S.A., and any amendment thereof. Licensee acknowledges that no Software, Data, Documentation or other underlying information or technology licensed hereunder may be accessed, downloaded, used, possessed or otherwise exported or re-exported to (or to a national or resident of) any country outside of the United States (including further export if you took delivery of the Software, Data or Documentation outside the United States) without first complying strictly and fully with all export controls and other applicable laws that may be imposed by the United States Government or any country or organization of nations within whose jurisdiction you use the Software, Data, Documentation or other underlying information or technology. Licensee acknowledges that some countries may have export controls, meteorological usage, import and export laws or other laws or regulations which prohibit or otherwise restrict the export to and/or use of the Software, Data, Documentation or other underlying information or technology. Determination of the applicable law and compliance therewith is Licensee’s sole obligation and responsibility. For any use contrary to the restrictions set forth herein or law, Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from any responsibility or liability in connection therewith. If Licensee has any questions regarding its obligations under the United States of America Export regulations, Licensee should contact the Bureau of Industry and Security, United States Department of Commerce, Office of Exporter Services, Washington D.C., https://www.bis.doc.gov/about/programoffices.htm. As to other countries, the appropriate officials or agencies should be contacted. Licensee represents and warrants that (i) he/she is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) he/she is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Provider Terms

Standards for Content Inclusion:

Materials provided to AccuWeather for inclusion on any website hosted or managed by AccuWeather may not and shall not violate any of the General Terms and Conditions of the agreement(s) with AccuWeather or any terms in any supplemental written terms and conditions, as well as any applicable website Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement, or End User License Agreement. Please pay close attention to the Acceptable Use Policy and the Notice Specific To Documents Available On This Website in the Terms and Conditions, because those sections outline specific behaviors that should be avoided when considering content for inclusion with AccuWeather products and service. Although the AccuWeather websites, products and services are not intended for use by children, these Standards for Content Inclusion are provided to ensure that materials accessible through the various AccuWeather websites, products and services are not objectionable to a broad spectrum of individuals, including the occasional end user under the age of 13. These Standards are also designed to optimally ensure that the AccuWeather websites, products and services do not (i) incorporate images or content that is in any way unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, or harassing; (ii) promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age; (iii) promote illegal activity or incorporate any materials which infringe or assist others to infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or other legal rights; (iv) present materials unsuitable for viewing by children under the age of 13; or (v) display content featuring competitors of AccuWeather.

Guidelines have been constructed to ensure that the above objectives are met, with little further involvement by AccuWeather. AccuWeather relies upon its business partners to act in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair play. These guidelines are flexible, designed to work with the rapidly changing media environments we live and work with. Many of our business partners have ever-changing business needs which dictate that we be allowed the freedom to update and modify these guidelines from time to time to ensure that our commitments to our business partners are met, while they maintain high quality standards on their end. Some of our business partners are also subject to tight government regulations imposed by agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. Given that need for flexibility, many of these guidelines are simply that: not a "hard and fast rule" of conduct, but a guideline meant for conservative interpretation by the end user and our Subscribers. We ask that you use common sense as a rule of thumb: our target audiences are information end users, from media giants to the single end user who benefits from the free services offered through our advertising-subsidized website. If the major networks, radio stations, and print publications wouldn't publish or broadcast it, then it most likely is "Inappropriate Content", and you shouldn't include it as content for inclusion in our products and services in any manner whatsoever, including, without limitation, branding and advertising space. Some examples of Inappropriate Content include content related to the following subjects:

Alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, liquor, etc.).
Tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, etc.).
Guns/weapons (firearms, bullets, etc.).
Illegal drugs (marijuana, cocaine, etc.).
Sexual (adult themes, sexual activities, pornography, etc.).
Crime and criminal conduct in general (organized crime, notorious characters, etc.).
Violence/Mayhem (physical harm or pain, torture, riots, etc.).
Dehumanizing (degrading, abuse, humiliating, etc.).
Death (funeral homes, mortuaries, etc.).
Hate (racial, religious, ethnic, etc.).
Gambling (casinos, lotteries, etc.).
Politics (lobbyists, political campaigns, etc.).
Illegal acts (violates, or promotes the violation of, any criminal law, etc.).
Controversial topics (social issues, abortion, etc.).
Unauthorized or unapproved use of any third party's intellectual property.
Copy or parody of current or past third party products or services
Implied affiliation, association or endorsement by, or favored status with AccuWeather, mobile carriers, or media companies.
There may be other types of content not specifically outline above that would be considered "Potentially Inappropriate Content." Once again, we ask you use a general rule of thumb using common sense, and err on the side of caution. When in doubt, ask your AccuWeather representative for assistance in interpreting these guidelines, and make sure you get written consent from AccuWeather if you intend to include items which may be considered Potentially Inappropriate Content.
