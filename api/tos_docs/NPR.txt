Subscription Services
Some NPR Services, such as the NPR+ podcast subscription service, may be available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee ("Subscription Services").

Subscription Term; Automatic Renewals

If you elect to subscribe to a Subscription Service then, in exchange for payment of the applicable fee (the "Fee"), you will have access to such Subscription Service for the period of time indicated during the subscription sign-up process. This may be a fixed period of time specified by NPR, or you may have the option of choosing among automatically renewing subscription term options, such as a subscription that automatically renews on a monthly or annual basis until cancelled, offered at different Fees. The period of time during which you may access the applicable Subscription Service is referred to in these Terms of Use as the "Subscription Term."

Your ability to access and use a Subscription Service will commence on the date we make such Subscription Service available to you following your payment of the applicable Fee for such service, and will continue until the end of the applicable Subscription Term.

If you have elected to subscribe to a Subscription Service with a Subscription Term that renews automatically (as disclosed to you during the subscription sign-up process) then, unless you affirmatively cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current Subscription Term, (1) we will automatically renew your subscription for subsequent new Subscription Terms of the same duration and will automatically charge the applicable Fee for each Subscription Term to the payment method you have provided, and (2) you hereby authorize us to do so. If you affirmatively cancel your subscription, your subscription will expire, and your access to the Subscription Service will cease, at the end of the then-current Subscription Term.

To continue to access the Subscription Services after your subscription has expired, you will need to purchase a new subscription. You are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date payment information. NPR assumes no responsibility or liability if your subscription fails to renew or otherwise expires because of outdated or incorrect payment information. You should maintain an up-to-date email account to receive communications about subscriptions. The FAQs on our Contact Us page, including the podcast subscriptions FAQs, provide details about administering your subscription.

In addition to offering Subscription Services through NPR platforms, we may make it possible for you to subscribe to a Subscription Service through one or more third-party platforms (e.g., Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.). Your subscription will be tied to, and may only be managed via, the platform through which you subscribe. If you subscribe to a Subscription Service through a third-party platform, you must maintain accurate and up-to-date payment information with that third-party platform in order to continue to access such Subscription Service. If you elect to subscribe to a Subscription Service via an NPR platform and you previously purchased a subscription to the same Subscription Service through a third-party platform, it is your responsibility to cancel your subscription with that third-party platform to avoid duplicate charges. Our Contact Us page provides information about canceling Subscription Services managed by certain third-party platforms. Please refer to the third-party platform through which you purchased or redeemed a Subscription Service for more details.

We will not provide any full or partial refund (except where the law requires us to provide a refund) or prorate Fees for Subscription Services, although the refund policies offered by third-party platforms may differ. If you purchased a subscription via a third-party platform, please refer to that platform's refund policies.

Promotions and Trials

From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer a Subscription Service through a promotional offer, code or discount, including pursuant to a trial offer of a Subscription Service for a specified time period without payment or at a reduced rate. We may determine your eligibility for a trial or other promotion, and may withdraw or modify any such promotion at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law. If you sign up for a Subscription Service through a promotional offer, code or discount, you may also be bound by additional or different terms communicated to you at sign up or otherwise in connection with the applicable offer. You agree to comply with those terms.

For some trials or other promotional offers, we will require you to provide your payment details to start the trial or otherwise access the promotion. By providing such details for a promotional or trial offer and accepting the applicable offer, you agree that we may automatically begin charging your payment method for a subscription to the applicable Subscription Service on the first day following the end of the trial or discounted promotional period at the regular price for such subscription and on a recurring monthly basis or other interval that we have disclosed to you in the applicable offer. If you do not want to pay these charges, you must cancel the applicable Subscription Service before the end of the applicable trial or promotion period. If you signed up for the trial through a third-party platform, you must cancel the applicable subscription through such third-party platform.

Access Restrictions

You are not authorized to access any Subscription Service unless you have created a subscription account and paid the applicable Fee for such service. You may not assist anyone else in accessing any Subscription Service(s) on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing any access credentials we provide to you, sharing links to a Subscription Service, or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through a Subscription Service to third parties. If we require that you use a password to protect your subscription account, please keep your password confidential. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and for all usage or activity that occurs within your Subscription Services accounts, including the use of Subscription Services by any third party authorized by you to use your access credentials. Such responsibility expressly includes any purchases made, or other charges incurred, in connection with your use (or an authorized third party's use) of the Subscription Services. You will be responsible for all charges and all purchasing activity that occurs within your account. We may turn off your access to your Subscription Service without notice, and without providing any refund, if we identify that access credentials have been shared.

Age and Billing Authorization

By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age, that all information submitted by you is true and correct (including all credit card information), and that you are the authorized holder of the credit card, digital wallet or other payment method associated with your subscription account.

Fees

You agree to pay all Fees and other charges applicable to your Subscription Services accounts, including any applicable taxes. NPR reserves the right to change the amount of, or the basis for determining, any subscription Fees for the Subscription Services and to institute new subscription Fees with prior notice to you. Any such changes will be effective on the first day of the next Subscription Term for the applicable Subscription Service unless we specify a different effective date in our notice to you. You accept such Fee changes by continuing to subscribe to the Subscription Service after the Fee change has taken effect. If you do not wish to agree to any such Fee change(s), you must cancel the applicable subscription before the effective date of the applicable change.

Compatible Apps

Some Subscription Services may be accessible only by using particular applications. You can find information about supported applications for each Subscription Service on our Contact Us page. You should review the details of each Subscription Service before you pay for access to ensure that the Subscription Service will work with your preferred application(s). We will not refund any Fees you paid if a Subscription Service to which you have subscribed is not accessible using your preferred application.

Territorial Limitations

Our Subscription Services may not be accessible for use in every jurisdiction. You can contact us though our Contact Us page for information about where the Subscription Services are accessible. We will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you have subscribed are not accessible where you are located. If you are subscribing to a Subscription Service through a third-party platform, review the platform provider's terms.

Suspension or Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to any or all Subscription Service(s) at any time, for any reason, without notice to you. If we do so, we will provide a partial refund to you, and you will not be responsible for Fees associated with such Subscription Service(s) after the termination becomes effective, unless you have breached or violated any of these Terms of Use.

Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription to a Subscription Service obtained through an NPR platform at any time by using the email you used to purchase your subscription to sign in to your account page at plus.npr.org and selecting 'Disable Auto-renew' under 'Change Plan'. If you subscribed through a third-party platform, you must follow the procedures described on the applicable third-party platform, which are also provided on our Contact Us page. If you are unable to locate the cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you can contact us at plus@npr.org. Requests to cancel subscriptions will be effective once the Subscription Term in which we received the cancellation concludes. If you purchased a subscription through a third-party platform, please refer to that platform's refund policies for more details. Instructions on our Contact Us page provide details for canceling Subscription Products managed by certain third-party platforms.

NPR+ Bundle
NPR is offering a bundle of sponsorship-free podcasts and certain other special features in select markets across the country in partnership with participating NPR Member stations. In those markets, the NPR+ bundle is available to individuals who become members of a local NPR station by making a minimum monthly or annual recurring donation to such station via the NPR+ bundle sign-up page on plus.npr.org. If you do not see the NPR+ bundle option when you visit plus.npr.org that means the NPR+ bundle is not currently available in your area.

The NPR+ bundle does not constitute a Subscription Service, as that term is used and defined above in these Terms of Use – rather, it is a thank-you gift that NPR is providing in recognition of donations made to participating NPR stations via plus.npr.org.

When you choose the NPR+ bundle, you are making a tax-free gift to directly support public radio in your area. If you select the NPR bundle option and become a member of your local NPR station via plus.npr.org, your monthly or annual recurring donation will automatically be charged by the NPR station you select, using the payment method you provided at the time of your initial donation. NPR will issue a transaction receipt to you upon completion of your initial donation transaction, but the donation transaction is between you and the NPR station to which you have elected to donate, and the station will issue any additional donation receipts that are required under applicable law. In appreciation of your donation, NPR will make available certain NPR+ benefits, as described below.

NPR+ Benefits

NPR will make available the NPR+ bundle, which will include sponsorship-free podcasts and other special features such as bonus content ("NPR+ Benefits"). NPR will not collect any fee(s) in exchange for providing the NPR+ Benefits, and the NPR+ bundle is not a paid service or a Subscription Service (as defined above in these Terms of Use). The NPR+ Benefits are a thank-you gift that NPR is providing in recognition of donations made to participating NPR stations via plus.npr.org.

NPR will make the NPR+ Benefits available to you for so long as you continue your recurring donation to your selected station, unless your selected NPR station elects to stop participating in NPR+, in which case the station will notify you that your NPR+ Benefits will be ending.

How to Cancel

You may cancel your recurring donation at any time by contacting your selected NPR station directly or by logging into your NPR+ account and using the account management tools we provide to you. If you cancel your recurring donation, you will cease to be a member of the selected NPR station and may lose access to the NPR+ Benefits.

Compatible Apps

Some NPR+ Benefits may be accessible only by using particular applications. You can find information about supported applications on our Contact Us page. You should review the supported applications to ensure the NPR+ Benefits will work with your preferred application(s).

Territorial Limitations

Some NPR+ Benefits may not be accessible for use in every jurisdiction. You can contact us though our Contact Us page for information about where the NPR+ Benefits are accessible.
